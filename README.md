# Censor_dispenser

An imaginary company is developing a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence engine designed to help provide a new perspective on the world's problems.
There are four emails that the head researchers sent to the board of investors and I'm asked to intercept them and censor any proprietaty information included in them.
I created four functions, one for each email, beginning with light censoring and ending with a heavy one.
